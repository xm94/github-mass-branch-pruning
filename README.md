# github-mass-branch-pruning - A Python script to delete branches en-masse

This is a small python script made for the purpose of pruning leftover branches by leveraging Github's python api. By default, this will ignore branches named 'main', 'master', 'production', 'prod', 'stable', and 'dev', but additional branches can be configured.
